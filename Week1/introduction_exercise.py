# For this exercise, you will need to change the value in this section of
# program.
# 
# This assignment will require that you enter your name in the string below.
# So if your name is "Isabel", then the line of code should look like:
#     your_name = "Isabel"
# 
# After you've made this change, save the file.
# Once saved, you must then run the program using the Python interepreter.
# 
# For this program and the rest of this class, you can safely ignore
# everything after the commented line with ten dashes.

your_name = "Isabel"
